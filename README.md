Arrhythmia Classification using Deep Learning | Python, TensorFlow, Keras

I Built an end-to-end ECG signal analysis pipeline using the MIT-BIH dataset, achieving 98%+ accuracy in heartbeat classification.
Designed and trained five deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, Hybrid CNN-LSTM, Ensemble) with Batch Normalization, Dropout, L2 regularization, and adaptive learning rate scheduling.
Implemented signal preprocessing, R-peak detection (XQRS), and class balancing to improve model robustness.
Evaluated performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and visualized model performance via confusion matrices and training curves.
Enhanced interpretability by grouping results into Normal, Moderate, and High-risk cardiac categories for clinical insight.

I Also added the data which i used to train the models, which was taken from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database
